+ Project summary: 

Billions of dollars are being spent every year by football clubs to buy and sign players, with some clubs spending well over 300 million euros/per year. 

To that end, the goal of the project is to find out what is the cheapest team that can qualify for Champions League. We will use linear optimization and feature selection to achieve this goal.
